Previously, you wrote a program named Admission for a college admissions office in which the user enters a numeric high school grade point average and an admission test score. The program displays Accept or Reject based on those values. Now, create a modified program named AdmissionModularized in which the grade point average and test score are passed to a method that returns a string containing Accept or Reject.
