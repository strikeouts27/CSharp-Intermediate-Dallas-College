Create an application for a library and name it FineForOverdueBooks. The Main() method asks the user to input the number of books checked out and the number of days they are overdue. These values must be passed in the same order to a method named DisplayFine. The method calculates and displays the library fine, which is 10 cents per book per day for the first seven days a book is overdue, then 20 cents per book per day for each additional day. Example function signature : public static void DisplayFine(int books, int days)

The library fine should be displayed in the following format:

The fine for 2 book(s) for 3 day(s) is $0.60
